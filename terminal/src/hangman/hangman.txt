Hangman
=======

This game searches a random word in a vocabulary that shows
2 words on each line. The first is Dutch, the second word is English,
like this:

een meer;a lake
een broodje;a roll

The program chooses from about 300 words.

The goal of the game is to guess a word correctly, thus saving
a person from the gallows. The player wins if she guesses right before
execution. Otherwise she loses.

Once chosen the player gets to guess one character at a time.
The player can see how long the word is and every time his guess
is correct, the player will see where in the word the character
fits. Once all characters are correct, the player wins.

If the player guesses a wrong character, the hangman is one step
closer to execution. Once the hangman gets executed, the player
loses

The number of turns is equal to the number of right guesses plus
the number of parts the hangman is made from, currently 6.

Have fun guessing words.
